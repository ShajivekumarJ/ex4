            Koyambedu is a busy and important area in Chennai city. It is well known for the Koyambedu wholesale market, one of the largest markets in Asia. People come here to buy vegetables, fruits, and flowers at low prices. Koyambedu also has a big bus stand and metro station, which makes travel easy. I like Koyambedu because it is lively, useful, and always full of activity.
