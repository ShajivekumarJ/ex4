            Chennai is my beautiful home town, located on the eastern coast of India along the Bay of Bengal. It is known for its rich culture, ancient temples, Marina Beach, and delicious South Indian food. Chennai is also a major center for education, IT industries, and classical music and dance. The people here are warm, respectful, and proud of their traditions. I love Chennai because it perfectly blends tradition with modern life.
