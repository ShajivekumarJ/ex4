            Thiruvanmiyur is a beautiful and peaceful area in Chennai, located near the seashore. It is famous for the Marundeeswarar Temple and the calm Thiruvanmiyur Beach. The area is clean, well-developed, and has good schools, colleges, and IT offices nearby. Travel is easy because of the MRTS railway and good bus facilities. I like Thiruvanmiyur because it is calm, safe, and close to nature.
